# PCSB_EoSs
Optimized cold matter Neutron Star equations of state based upon the Relativisitc Mean Field (RMF) Approximation.

The detail of the parameteriziation for each EoSs can be found from the Table 2 of [ref].




All EoSs satisfies the PNM matter constraints resulting from  chiral effective field theory. Whereas, PCSB0, PCSB1, and PCSB2 satisfy both the Astro-physical constraints (GW170817+NICER) and the chiral effective field theory.
