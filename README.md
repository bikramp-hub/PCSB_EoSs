## PCSB_EoSs
  * Optimized cold matter Neutron Star equations of state based upon the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) Approximation.

  * The details of the parametrization for each EoS can be found in Table 2 of [Pradhan et al.,2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12657).
  * EoSs are given for,
  ```math
   \rm 9 * 10^{-11}\  fm^{-3} \leq n_b \leq 1.42 \ fm^{-3},
   
   \rm where\  n_b \ is\  the \ baryon\ number \   density.
   ```
   * Read columns as 
   ```math
   1.n_b/n_0\   2.n_b \ (\rm fm^{-3})\  3.Energy \ Density \  (MeV \ fm^{-3}) \ 4.Pressure \  (MeV \ fm^{-3}).
  ```

 * All EoSs satisfy the PNM matter constraints resulting from chiral effective field theory, while PCSB0, PCSB1, and PCSB2 satisfy both the astro-physical constraints (GW170817+NICER) and the chiral effective field theory.
